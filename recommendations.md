- Assign a *unique invoice ID* to each transaction to ensure accurate tracking and aggregation.
- Review and standardize *data entry processes* to avoid missing values, duplicated records, and inconsistent formatting.
- Create a *Date Dimension Table* and link it to the Fact Sales table to enable accurate time-based analysis and reporting.
